Author: 
Title
Note text
Completed Status
Archive Status
Priority Level
Categories (future features)
Timestamp

Scope creep = Revision Cycle Hell
Note: Someone wants a feature and it causes you to never complete the app. To counter this, write down the app feature you want and do it later

FRONT-END REQUEST OBJECT:
{
author: null
title: string
text: string
completed: boolean
archived: boolean
priority: number
categories: null
timestamp: number (MILLISECONDS FROM DATE OBJECT)
}

BACK-END RESPONSE OBJECT {
saved: boolean
error: String (future feature)
}
Note: Backend is in index.js
App.post(callback, route)

FRONT-END REQUEST:
Name: newNote (This is what we named it)
Send: Request Object Object Above
Return: Response Object Above

$post(url, data, callback) 
Note ignore 404 Error because this isn't run in the backend

IF YOU FORGOT TO ADD A .GITIGNORE FILE
git reset
