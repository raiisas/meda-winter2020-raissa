REACT
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library (framework) for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

What are frameworks?
Whereas libraries are pre-written code to help with your code, frameworks are organize the content like an architecture. All frameworks are designed to speed up Frontend.

Note: Don't use jQuery for React

Comparisons

1. Set up on browser or local environment (we used the later)
2. npm init
3. sudo npm install -S create-react-app
4. npx create-react-app tutorial-app (can be used to bypass sudo || use for whole plugins)
5. Success! Created tutorial-app at /Users/push/Documents/MEDA/meda-winter2020-raissa/assignments/week8/react/tutorial-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd tutorial-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
6. Ls 
7. Cd tutorial-app
8 npm start
9. Ignore Xcode - but - allow terminal access
10. Create .gitignore and ignore node_modules/

11. Compiled successfully!

You can now view tutorial-app (we named the folder) in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.236:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

12. Delete contents in src (source) folder
13.Create index. css and index.js from Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment
14. Add code from Step 6 in https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
15. Npm start

16. React deals with JXS props and elements
